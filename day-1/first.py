#when we use print function .. we indicate the terminal to print everything in the parenthesis 
# to be printed on console or output screen
#for example i am printiing my name .. as below
print("Vimla Kushwaha")
print("4-sept-2025")
# and when i will run this program -- it will reflect as Vimla Kushwaha on the output screen
